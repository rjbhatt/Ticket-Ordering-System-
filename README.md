# Ticket-Ordering-System-
This program executes a menu that can be used to order tickets for various sports teams in the state of Michigan. Users can select the preferred team by selecting the number corresponding to the team they wish to purchase tickets for (Ex. 1 = Pistons). The available teams are: Pistons, Red Wings, Tigers, and the Lions. The allowable valid numbers are 1-4 which correspond to the aforementioned teams respectively. Entering the digit “0” will exit the menu. The prices of each subsequent ticket selection will be calculated accordingly along with a final total.
